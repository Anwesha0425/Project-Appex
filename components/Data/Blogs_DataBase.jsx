Proper training in crop management, water management, and seed treatment can unlock the potential of small and marginal farmers, ensuring optimum productivity and sustainable income. Initiatives like the Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI) have focused on enhancing rice productivity through scientific methods such as line sowing and irrigation management. Similarly, programs like the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Accelerated Pulses Production Programme (A3P) have demonstrated the impact of nutrient and pest management technologies on crops like Arhar, Black Gram, and Green Gram. Inter-cropping practices, such as Cotton with Arhar, have further optimized land use and increased yields. Additionally, campaigns on seed treatment and hybrid crop demonstrations, including maize and sunflower, have played a critical role in minimizing pest damage while maximizing production. These efforts, supported by organizations and government schemes, continue to empower farmers, enhance food security, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.'

With advancements in agricultural practices, modern farming has evolved into a dynamic field, integrating traditional knowledge with innovative techniques like crop rotation, inter-cropping, and seed treatment. By adopting scientific methods such as line sowing, nutrient management, and water conservation, farmers can significantly boost productivity and ensure efficient resource utilization. Initiatives like Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs) and community-driven programs empower small and marginal farmers with essential skills and access to technology. Demonstration projects for crops like rice, maize, and pulses have highlighted the transformative potential of systematic training and technical guidance. Beyond cultivation, farming has also become a hub for sustainable practices, emphasizing soil health, biodiversity, and eco-friendly methods. Through these efforts, farming is not only about growing crops but about fostering resilient communities and ensuring food security for future generations.'

Empowering small and marginal farmers with technical knowledge and modern agricultural practices enhances productivity and ensures sustainable farming. Training programs focus on critical aspects such as crop management, water conservation, seed treatment, and pest control, enabling farmers to overcome traditional challenges. Awareness campaigns and hands-on demonstrations, such as line sowing, inter-cropping, and hybrid crop cultivation, equip farmers with practical skills and innovative techniques. Vocational training through Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs) fosters collaboration, collective problem-solving, and the adoption of advanced methods. Linking farmers with organizations like Agricultural Technology Management Agencies (ATMA) provides access to cutting-edge technologies and expert guidance. These training initiatives not only boost crop yield but also empower farmers to adapt to changing climates, diversify their income sources, and contribute to community growth. In essence, farmer training is the foundation of agricultural resilience and rural transformation.'

This initiative aimed to enhance the skills and knowledge of ASHAs in improving maternal and newborn health, child nutrition, and overall community health. By training over 500 ASHAs from various Community Health Centers (CHCs) in the Ganjam district, the program provided practical knowledge on antenatal care, newborn care, breastfeeding, and reproductive health, alongside skills like using diagnostic tools such as Nischay kits and digital thermometers, wrapping newborns to prevent hypothermia, and maintaining essential health records. This training played a pivotal role in equipping ASHAs with the expertise to contribute significantly to reducing Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in Odisha.'
